Streamlit demo for classifying animals. You can use Streamlit to create interactive Data Science pages, deployable to the web through all major deployment surfaces. 

## Getting Started

Using a python3 (preferably 3.7) environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Recommend using conda or virtualenv to sandbox your work

### Manual Install 
Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda does not come with TensorFlow or Keras so you will need to install those seperately. 
```
pip install tensorflow keras
```
